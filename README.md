  An Engine made with Python
</h2>
<p align="justify">We all know that it's something out of the ordinary; however, we should never turn down the opportunity to embark on a crazy experiment under any circumstances!<br>
The Orochi Engine features several modules that enable the creation of 2D games for the Windows platform. Managing animations, databases, files, sprites, objects, and online games with Orochi is extremely straightforward.<br>
Developed in Python, Orochi gives users an incredible level of control over their code, allowing the installation of external libraries, the use of threads, and the exploration of system functions in an uncomplicated manner. Furthermore, it's possible to compile your game without needing prior knowledge.<br>
As a developer, I recognize that this game engine has its imperfections and defects. However, I commit to improving it every day and continuing this project with the valuable contribution of all of you!</p>

<p align="justify">
The Orochi Engine is 100% free and open source, relying solely on other open source technologies while giving them proper credit. These are the most significant tools during the development of our engine:

</p>
</p>
<p align = "justify">
As a user, you have the ability to access the modules of the game engine and modify them at will, optimizing and enhancing them. Furthermore, you can share your improvement ideas with us, and we will certainly give them the attention they deserve!

<p align = "justify" >Creating games and exporting them with Orochi is incredibly easy. Thanks to its vast library of functions and modules, it facilitates the smooth and continuous development of your projects. You don't need to create intricate logics for systems that already exist within Orochi! The game from the gif above was made in just one hour. Ready for use, the process of exporting your projects to the .exe format is fast and straightforward.</p>

<p align="justify">You can make the work of other developers easier by creating scripts for the community. Develop simple systems that you find useful during game development, such as camera shaking systems, preset movements and actions for objects, and dialogue systems. Scripts that meet all the basic requirements will be included in the "community" module of the engine.</p>
